#### Speaker Verification

Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices.[1] It is used to answer the question "Who is speaking?". Additionally, speaker verification (also called speaker authentication) contrasts with identification, and speaker recognition differs from speaker diarisation (recognizing when the same speaker is speaking).

#### Automatic Speech Recognition

Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text. It is also known as speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The most common ways of performing ASR is either with hybrid-based STT (HMM/DNN) and sequence-to-sequence models. Our SST block relies on the later, developed with [speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain).
