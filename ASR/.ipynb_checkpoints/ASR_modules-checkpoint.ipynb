    "## **Step 1: Tokenizer** \n",
    "An important decision to make when designing a speech recognizer concerns the basic tokens that our system has to predict (e.g, characters, phonemes, sub-words, words).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using characters as tokens**\n",
    "One way is to predict characters. In this case, we simply convert the sequence of words into its corresponding sequence of characters (using the space '_' as an additional character):\n",
    "\n",
    "`THE CITY OF BOGOTA IN COLOMBIA => ['T','H','E', '_', 'C','I','T','Y','_', 'O', 'F', '_, 'B','O','G','O','T','A','_','I','N','_','C','O','L','O','M','B','I''A']`\n",
    "\n",
    "Key information about using characters as tokens:\n",
    "+ Enough training data for each token, our system would need to predict between 20-30 tokens (depending on the language),\n",
    "+ Out system might generalize to words never seen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using words as tokens**\n",
    "Why not predicting full words then? \n",
    "\n",
    "`THE CITY OF BOGOTA IN COLOMBIA => ['THE','CITY','OF','BOGOTA', 'IN', 'COLOMBIA']`\n",
    "\n",
    "Key information about using words as tokens:\n",
    "+ Output sequence is short (only words) and some symbols if defined.\n",
    "+ The system, however, cannot anymore generalize to new words \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**\n",
    "What about something in between? \n",
    "This is what we are trying to do with BPE tokens. BPE is a simple technique inherited from data compression. The basic idea is to allocate tokens for the most frequent sequences of characters. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "`THE CITY OF BOGOTA IN COLOMBIA => ['▁TH', 'E', '▁C', 'I', 'TY', '▁OF', '▁BO', 'G', 'O', 'TA', '▁I', 'N', '▁C', 'O', 'L', 'OM', 'B', 'IA']`\n",
    "\n",
    "The [algorithm that finds these tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) is very simple: we start from the characters and we count how many times two consecutive characters are observed together. We allocate a token for the most frequent pair and we iterate over and over until a specified number of tokens is reached. For more information, you can take a look at [our tutorial on the tokenizers](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12yE3myHSH-eUxzNM0-FLtEOhzdQoLYWe?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *How many BPE tokens should I use?*\n",
    "The number of tokens is one of the hyperparameters of your system.\n",
    "Its optimal value depends on the amount of speech data available. Just to give you an idea, for LibriSpeech (i.e., 1000 hours of sentences in English) a reasonable number of tokens ranges between 1k and 10k.\n",

Additionally, we learned how to use the `EncoderDecoderASR` interface which allows you to perform speech recognition with less than 4 lines of code! \n",
